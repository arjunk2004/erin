# Erin
Erin is a helpful productivity tool to allow you to quickly open urls, find files, etc. You can easily add functionality to erin by adding to the "modules" folder. The file should be named like such: "your_command.sh". This program is inspired by the Alfred App for MacOS. On the other hand, Erin is exclusive to Ubuntu, based on bash and zenity. Erin is created to maximize expandibility.
